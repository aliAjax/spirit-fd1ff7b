// TestStateOrder is a safety-net tripwire for the ordinal values of the State
// iota block in state.go. The integer ORDER of these constants is load-bearing:
// code elsewhere gates safety behavior on the ordinal via >= / > comparisons
// rather than equality. A future reorder or insertion into the const block would
// silently change which states satisfy those gates and invert the safety logic.
//
// Known ordinal-comparison sites that depend on this order (non-exhaustive):
//   - pkg/migration/runner.go: `state >= Checksum` gates persisting the
//     checkpoint's checksum_watermark; `state >= CutOver` makes fatalError()
//     a no-op (errors after cutover are expected and must not cancel/invalidate).
//   - pkg/move/runner.go: `state >= Checksum` and `state >= CutOver` gate the
//     continuous-checksum loop and post-cutover error handling.
//   - pkg/status/task.go: `state > CutOver` / `state >= CutOver` gate progress
//     reporting and terminal-state handling.
//   - state.go itself documents that WaitingOnSentinelTable must sort AFTER
//     Checksum so that `state >= Checksum` stays true while the sentinel wait
//     blocks the cutover.
//   - pkg/move/reversewindow.go: the ReverseWindow state sorts AFTER CutOver so
//     the post-cutover reverse window satisfies `state >= CutOver` (fatalError
//     becomes a no-op; the status/checkpoint dumpers stop) — intended.
//
// If you INTENTIONALLY reorder or insert a State, update the expected values
// below AND audit every `>=` / `>` / `<` comparison against a State constant to
// confirm the safety gates still hold.
